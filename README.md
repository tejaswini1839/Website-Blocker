# Website-Blocker
Website blocker is a tool that denies access to websites 
permanently or by schedule. To use the internet safely we can block all 
websites from unwanted categories.
We are going to develop python application which will block a 
certain website (whatever website you want- Facebook, YouTube etc.) 
during certain hours of the day (9:00 to 18:00 hours), consider office hours 
or study hours of the day, we want to blocks all social networking sites. 
We are going to use the python built-in libraries, so no need to install any 
third-party packages.
